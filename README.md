# Smartwatch-Price-Prediction
Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the price of smartwatches using various machine learning models. By analyzing key features of different smartwatch models, the aim is to build an accurate predictive model that estimates the price based on relevant factors.

Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Implementation of multiple machine learning models.

Model evaluation and comparison.

Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization.

Visualization of key insights.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartwatch-price-prediction.git

cd smartwatch-price-prediction

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook MLrf.ipynb

Dataset

The dataset contains various features of smartwatches, such as:

Brand

Display Type

Battery Life

Connectivity (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.)

Health Tracking Features

Water Resistance

Price (Target Variable)

Model Implementation

The following models have been implemented:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Decision Tree Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor

Evaluation Metrics

To assess model performance, the following metrics are used:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared Score (R²)

Results

The models are compared based on their prediction accuracy. The best-performing model is selected based on R-squared scores and error minimization.
